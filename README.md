# cat-quiz

**A simple game for cat lovers 
I'm building to reiforce and learn new skills in web development.**

DISCLAIMER: Some code of this project was developed in the selection process 
for the [Laboratoria's Front-end Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/Laboratoria/bootcamp/blob/main/README.md). That deliverable can be found [here](https://trivia.josselynludena.repl.co/). 

The main task is to build a web application that allows a user to answer 
different questions by choosing their answers from a list of alternatives.
The main objective of this project is to have a first experience developing 
web applications (WebApp) that interact with the user through the browser and logic,
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as tools.

**The MVP (minimum viable product) of your implementation must:**

1. Show a welcome screen, ask for your name to start playing.
2. Show a Hello [your name] message and 2 buttons to start playing.
3. Play with type A questions (about cats)
4. Play with type B questions (about another subject)
5. Launch question 1 with alternatives, the user answers, then question 2 and then question 3 are shown.
6. Show a results screen (correct answers) 
7. And 2 buttons: play again or exit window.
