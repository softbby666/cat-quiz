# cat-quiz

A simple game for cat lovers.

I'm building this brief quiz to reiforce and learn new skills in web development. A part of this project was developed in the selection process for the Laboratoria's Front-end Development Bootcamp. That deliverable can be found [here] (https://trivia.josselynludena.repl.co/). as a part of the selection process for Laboratoria's Front-end Development bootcamp. build a web application that allows a user to answer different questions by choosing their answers from a list of alternatives.
The main objective of this project is to have a first experience developing web applications (WebApp) that interact with the user through the browser and logic, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as tools.
