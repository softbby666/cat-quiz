**A simple game for cat lovers
I'm building to reiforce and learn new skills in web development.**

DISCLAIMER: Some code of this project was developed in the selection process
for the [Laboratoria's Front-end Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/Laboratoria/bootcamp/blob/main/README.md). That deliverable can be found [here](https://trivia.josselynludena.repl.co/).

## Description

The main task is to build a web application that allows a user to answer
different questions by choosing their answers from a list of alternatives.
The main objective of this project is to have a first experience developing
web applications (WebApp) that interact with the user through the browser and logic,
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as tools.
